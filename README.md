</h2>
    <p align="center">Essentially, I have created a collection of useful stocks and functions into one massive library, to fasten the developments.
        I want to upgrade the collection with the AlliedModders community, so if you can improve this library or attach other files or new stocks,
        hit throw me with a pull request and let's build/enhance it together! Every contributor and also people whose functions are used other than
        mine own ones, gets credited.</p>
